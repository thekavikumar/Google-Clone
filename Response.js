The combined values of each alternative have been ordered with the help of score function to find the best attributes.

              "Neutrosophic sets are employed to be handled indeterminacy in a real-life situation. Thus, neutrosophic approaches in the medical domain prove their excellence. The neutrosophic hidden Markov model is an inventiveness domain for uncertainty. The existing hidden Markov models are not able to consider the uncertainty information, but the neutrosophic hidden Markov model effectively finds the optimal path between the states where vagueness exists. The proposed study comprises the idea of single-value and interval-valued neutrosophic sets into the hidden Markov model and decoding the path using the Viterbi algorithm. It has been used to determine the sequence of motility primitives for an afforded time series. The method is to be handled without having a lower membership function for falsity, and because of this advantage, one can save time significantly during computation. The neutrosophic score helps to find the crisp value of the probability. Moreover, the proposed work highlights the main childhood obesity ri",
